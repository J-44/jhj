        <br>
        <p>Painting has been a hobby I have embraced for quite some time. Ever since I took the paintbrush and just crafted something on paper, I have never looked back on it. Painting has been a hobby that gives me joy because I can draw my imaginations into an art piece and make the best out of it.</p><br><br>
